/**
 * Role management endpoints for creating and managing custom roles.
 *
 * This controller handles:
 * - Creating new custom roles with specific permission sets
 * - Updating existing custom role details and permissions
 * - Deleting custom roles (with appropriate safeguards)
 * - Listing all available roles (both default and custom)
 *
 * Role Management Rules:
 * - Default system roles (self, owner) or other default roles are protected and cannot be modified
 * - Only users with 'owner' or 'role_manager' role can create, update, or delete custom roles
 * - Permissions assigned to roles are system-defined and cannot be altered
 *
 * All endpoints require authentication via Bearer token with appropriate permissions.
